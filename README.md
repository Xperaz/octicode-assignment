# How to run ?

## First choice

- `docker compose up -d`
- Now you can see the app in your localhost : `   `

  I assume that you have docker in your machine, and it's running.

## Second choice

    - run backend:
        1. First go to bakcend drictory: type ``` cd backend ``` in your terminal from root prject dirctory.
        2. Then run ``` npm install ```.
        3. Run ``` npm start ```.

    - To run backend tests:
        - Run ``` npm test ```


    - Run front end:
        1. 1. First go to frontend drictory: type ``` cd frontend ``` in your terminal from root prject dirctory.
        2. Then run ``` npm install ```.
        3. Run ``` npm start ```.

    - Now you can see the app in your localhost ``` localhost:3000 ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > If you decide to use scond choice please run backend first then frontend.
