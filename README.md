# octicode-assignment

Create a Rest API to get their users from a Database and display them. Using Vanilla nodejs for the backend and reactjs for the frontend and tailwindcss for styling.

# How to run?

> [!NOTE]  
> You can find the `.env` file in the repository. I know it's not ideal to have it here, but it's just for testing purposes.

## First choice

1. Go to the root directory, then open your terminal: `docker compose up -d`
2. Now you can see the app in your localhost: ``` localhost:3000 ```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I assume that you have docker in your machine, and it's running.

## Second choice

 1. run backend:
    - First go to the backend directory: type ``` cd backend ``` in your terminal from the root project directory.
    - Then run ``` npm install ```.
    - Run ``` npm start ```.

 2. Run front end:
    - First go to the frontend directory: type ``` cd frontend ``` in your terminal from the root project directory.
    - Then run ``` npm install ```.
    - Run ``` npm start ```.

 4. Now you can see the app in your localhost ``` localhost:3000 ```

 - To run backend tests:
   - Run ``` npm test ```
 
  
  > [!WARNING]
   > If you decide to use the second choice please run the backend first then frontend.
